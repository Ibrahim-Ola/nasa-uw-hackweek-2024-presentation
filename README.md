## Neural Networks in PyTorch

This repository consists of a tutorial on the basics of Neural Networks and Neural Networks with PyTorch. I presented this document at the [NASA Earth Sciences & University of Washington Hackweek 2024](https://2024.hackweek.io/) at the eScience Institute of the University of Washington, Seattle. The tutorial is deployed on [UW eScience Hackweek Website](https://snowex-2024.hackweek.io/tutorials/NN_with_Pytorch/intro.html). Learn more about Hackweeks [here](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/).
