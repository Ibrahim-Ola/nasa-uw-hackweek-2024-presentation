    "Welcome to the \"Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch\" tutorial! In this session, we'll explore the basics of neural networks and how to implement them using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. Our goal is to help you get acquainted with the fundamental concepts of neural networks and give you some hands-on experience with PyTorch. Whether you're new to neural networks or looking to refresh your knowledge, this tutorial is designed to guide you through the key ideas at a comfortable pace. By the end of the workshop, youâ€™ll have a better understanding of how neural networks work and how you can start using PyTorch for your own projects.\n"
